OMINAS
Top level module

  This is the OMINAS top-level module.  Modules may be
  added to OMINAS as follows:

  1. Create a directory at the appropriate point in the 
     tree, e.g., $OMINAS/trs/cas/iss

  2. Create a subdirectory named module/.

  3. Place the relevant tables and code defining the module
     (see below) in the module/ directory.  

  4. Run OMIN.  OMIN will automatically detect the new
     module and add it to the tree.  It will be available the
     next time OMINAS is run.

  The following files can be placed in the module directory.  
  They are not all required depending on the purpose of the
  module:

  module_description.txt :
	Contains text to be displayed by OMIN (e.g. the text
	you are currently reading).  Note that the first line
	is used as the label in the OMIN tree rather than 
	being displayed in the description window.

  setup.sh : 
	Contains shell code to be copied to .ominas/ominas_setup.sh
	for execution at startup.

  properties.txt :
	Contains directives to OMIN for default configuration of
	the module.  [[list directives]]

  detect_<module.pro : (e.g. detect_trs_cas_iss.pro)
	Code for detecting whether a given data descriptor
	pertains to this module.

  module_install_<module>.pro : (e.g. module_install_trs_cas_iss.pro)
	Contains code for downloading and installing any data
	required by the module.
