# If you need to add commands to be executed before starting OMINAS,
# we suggest placing them either in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile (in
# which case they will be executed before ~/.ominas/ominas_setup.sh), or
# in ~/.ominas/ominas_postsetup.sh (which is executed after ~/.ominas/ominas_setup.sh, 
# thus it can make use of other OMINAS variables).
# ~/.ominas/ominas_setup.sh is never overwritten by configure.sh
