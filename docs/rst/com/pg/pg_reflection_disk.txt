pg_reflection_disk


 NAME:
	pg_reflection_disk


 PURPOSE:
	Computes image coordinates of given inertial vectors reflected onto
	surface of the given disk with respect to the given observer.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	result = pg_reflection_disk(object_ptd, cd=cd, ods=ods, dkx=dkx)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	object_ptd:	Array of POINT containing inertial vectors.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	Array (n_timesteps) of camera descriptors.

	dkx:	Array (n_disks, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects
		which must be a subclass of DISK.

	od:	Array (n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects
		which must be a subclass of BODY.  These objects are used
		as the source from which points are projected.  If no observer
		descriptor is given, then the camera descriptor in gd is used.
		Only one observer is allowed.

	gd:	Generic descriptor.  If given, the descriptor inputs
		are taken from this structure if not explicitly given.

	dd:	Data descriptor containing a generic descriptor to use
		if gd not given.

	reveal:	 Normally, disks whose opaque flag is set are ignored.
		 /reveal suppresses this behavior.

	clip:	 If set reflection points are cropped to within this many camera
		 fields of view.

	cull:	 If set, POINT objects excluded by the clip keyword
		 are not returned.  Normally, empty POINT objects
		 are returned as placeholders.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN: NONE
	Array (n_disks,n_objects) of POINT containing image
	points and the corresponding inertial vectors.


 STATUS:
	Soon to be obsolete.  This program will be merged with pg_shadow_globe
	to make a more general program, which will replace pg_shadow.
