pg_farfit


 NAME:
	pg_farfit


 PURPOSE:
	Searches for the offset (dx,dy) that gives the best agreement between
	two uncorrelated sets of image points.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	dxy = pg_farfit(dd, base_ptd, model_ptd)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dd:		Data descriptor.

	base_ptd:	POINT giving a set of points to fit to.
			This input may be produced by pg_edges, for example.

	model_ptd:	Array of POINT giving model points (computed
			limb points for example).

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	show:		If specified, the search is displayed in the current
			graphics window.  This value can be specified as a
			2-element array giving the size of the displayed image.

	bin:		Initial bin size for point densities.  Default is 50
			pixels.

	max_density:	Maximum model point density.  Default = 5.

	nsamples:	Number of samples in each direction in the grid search.
			See image_correlate.

	region:		Size of region to scan, centered at offset [0,0].  If not
			specified, the entire image is scanned.

	sigma:		2-element array giving the width of the correlation
			peak in each direction.

	cc:		Cross correlation of final result.

	mcc:		Corss correlation at the model points.

	bias:		If given, solutions are biased toward the initial
			guess using a weighting function of the form:

				exp(-r^2/2*bias),

			where r is the distance between from the initial
			guess.

	nosearch:	If set, no search is performed.  An offset of [0,0]
			is returned.


  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	2-element array giving the fit offset as [dx,dy].


 PROCEDURE:
	pg_farfit is a wrapper for the routine correlate_points.  See the
	documentation for that routine for details on the fitting procedure


 STATUS:
	Complete.
