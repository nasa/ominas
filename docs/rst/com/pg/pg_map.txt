pg_map


 NAME:
	pg_map


 PURPOSE:
	Generates map projections.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	result = pg_map(dd, md=md, cd=cd, gbx=gbx, ltd=ltd)
	result = pg_map(dd, gd=gd)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dd:	Data descriptor containing image to be projected.

 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	md:	Map descriptor describing the projection.

	cd:	Camera descriptor describing the image to be projected.

	bx:	Subclass of BODY giving the body to be projected.  Can be
		GLOBE or RING.  Only bodies whose names match that in the
		map descriptor are mapped.

	gbx:	Globe descriptor describing the body to be projected.
		This argument is kept for compatibility with earlier
		code.  It is recommended that you use the 'bx' argument
		instead.

	dkx:	Disk descriptor describing the body to be projected.
		This argument is kept for compatibility with earlier
		code.  It is recommended that you use the 'bx' argument
		instead.

	ltd:	Star descriptor for a light source.  If given, points behind the
		terminator are excluded.

	gd:	Generic descriptor.  If given, the above descriptor inputs
		are taken from the corresponding fields of this structure
		instead of from those keywords.

	hide_fn:
		String giving the name of a function whose purpose
		is to exclude hidden points from the map.  Options are:
		   pm_hide_ring
		   pm_hide_globe
		   pm_rm_globe_shadow
		   pm_rm_globe

	hide_bx:
		Array of BODY objects for the hide functions; one per
		function.

	aux_names:
		Array (naux) giving udata names for additional data
		descriptor planes to reproject.  The dimensions of these
		planes must be the same as the image.

	pc_xsize, pc_ysize:
		The map is generated in pieces of size pc_xsize
		x pc_ysize.   Default is 100 x 100 pixels.

	bounds:
		Projection bounds specified as [lat0, lat1, lon0, lon1].

	edge:	Minimum proximity to image edge.  Default is 0.

	roi:	Subscripts in the output map specifying the map region
		to project, instead of the whole thing.

	interp:	Type of interpolation, see image_interp_cam.

	arg_interp:	Interpolation argument, see image_interp_cam.

	offset:	Offset in [lat,lon] to apply to map coordinates before
		projecting.

	smooth:	If set, the input image is smoothed before reprojection.

	test_factor:	If set, a test map, reduced in size by this factor,
			is projected to determine the roi.  For maps with
			large blank areas, this may speed up the projection
			greatly.


  OUTPUT:
	map:	For convenience, the generated map is returned here as
		well as in the returned data descriptor.


 RETURN:
	Data descriptor containing the output map.  The instrument field is set
	to 'MAP'.  User data arrays are created for the reprojected aux_names
	arrays.


 STATUS:
	Complete
