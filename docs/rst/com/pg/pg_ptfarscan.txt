pg_ptfarscan


 NAME:
	pg_ptfarscan


 PURPOSE:
	Attempts to find all occurrences of a model in an image.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	result = pg_ptfarscan(dd)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dd:		Data descriptor

  OUTPUT:
       NONE

 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
       model:          Point spread model to be used in correlation.  If
                       not given a default gaussian is used.

	wmod:		x, ysize of default gaussian model.

	wpsf:		Half width of default gaussian psf model.

       edge:           Distance from edge from which to ignore points.  If
                       not given, an edge distance of 0 is used.

       gdmax:		If given, the maximum gradiant of correlation coefficient
			to accept.

       ccmin:          Minimum correlation to consider in search.  Default
			is 0.8.

       gdmax:          If given, points where the gradient of the
                       correlation function is higher than this value
			are not considered in the search.

	sky:		If set, it is assumed that the image contains only
			point sources and sky.  Any object more than nsig
			standard deviations above the image mean are
			selected as candidates.

	nsig:		For use with the /sky option, standard deviation
			threshold for detecting point sources.

	nmax:		Max. number of point sources to return.  If more
			are found, nsig is raised until thiws is satisified.

	smooth:		If given, the input image is smoothed using
			this width before any further processing.

	median:		If given, the input image is filtered using
			a median filter of this width before any further
			processing.

	mask:		If set, an attempt is made to mask out extended
			objects before performing the scan

	extend:		If nonzero, star masks are extended by this
			many pixels in all directions.

	name:		Name to use for the returned POINT objects.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	An array of type POINT giving the detected position for
       each object.  The correlation coeff value for each detection is
       saved in the data portion of POINT with tag 'scan_cc'.
