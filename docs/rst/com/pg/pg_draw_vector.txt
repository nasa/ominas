pg_draw_vector


 NAME:
	pg_draw_vector



 PURPOSE:
         Draws vectors on an image from a source towards a
         target. Very useful for locating off-image objects
         (planets, say) in an image for referencing.  By default,
         vectors are foreshortened to their projections onto the image
         plane so that vectors with large  out-of-plane components
         will be shorter.  (This can be deactivated with the
         /noshorten keyword.)  Also by default, vectors that point
         away from the camera will be drawn as dotted lines while
         vectors which point towards the camera will be drawn solid.
         (This can be controlled with the /solid keyword.)



 CATEGORY:
         NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
                 pg_draw_vector, sources, targets,
                 (cd=cd| gd=gd)[, /literal, thick=thick, lengths=lengths,
                  colors=colors, plabels=plabels, csizes=csizes]



 INPUTS:
        sources:         Inertial positions of sources.  Either an array
                         of column vectors (nv x 3 x nt) or an array of
                         POINT objects containing the inertial vectors.

        targets:         Inertial positions of targets, or inertial unit
                         vectors giving directions to targets.  Either an
                         array of column vectors (nv x 3 xnt) or an array
                         of POINT objects.  There must either be a single
                         target point or a one-to-one match between source
                         and target points.



 OPTIONAL INPUTS:



 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       cd or gd        A camera descriptor or a generic descriptor
                       containing a camera descriptor.  Required unless
			source and target given as image points.

	literal:	All of the following input keywords accept an array
			where each element corresponds to an element in the
			object_ptd array.  By default, if the keyword array is
			shorter than the object_ptd array, then the last element
	  		is used to fill out the array.  /literal suppresses
			this behavior and causes unspecified elements to
			take their default values

       lengths:        Lengths of the vectors.  (Default: 50 pixels)

       thick:         Line thicknesses.  (Default: 1)

       colors:         Colors to use in drawing.  (Default: current
                       default color)

       plabels:         Text with which to label vectors.  (Default:
                       no label)

       csizes:      Character sizes for plabels.  (Default: 1)

       solid:         All lines are to be drawn solid (linestyle=0)
                       rather than allow vectors pointing into the
                       image plane to be dotted.

       noshorten:     If set, vectors will not be foreshortened
                       depending on how much they point into/out
                       of the image plane.

       fixedheads:     If set, arrowheads will not be scaled to
                        match the foreshortening of the vector.

 OUTPUTS:
        None


 EXAMPLE:
       Say moon_points is a POINT object containing the center
       data for the four Galilean satellites and jupiter_points has
       Jupiter's center data.  Then

       IDL> pg_draw_vector, moon_points, jupiter_points, colors=[100, $
             150, 200, 250], thick=1.25, length=70, plabels="Jupiter", $
             csizes=1.5

       will draw vectors from each towards the planet.  Conversely,

       IDL> pg_draw_vector, jupiter_points, moon_points, colors=[100, $
             150, 200, 250], thick=1.25, length=70, plabels=["Io", "Europa", $
             "Ganymede", "Callisto"], csizes=1.5

       will draw vectors from Jupiter's center towards each moon,
       labelling each by the moon's name.
