pg_get_arrays


 NAME:
	pg_get_arrays


 PURPOSE:
	Obtains a array descriptor for the given data descriptor.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	result = pg_get_arrays(arg1, arg2)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	arg1:	Data descriptor or transient translator argument.  In the
		latter case, a string containing keywords and values to be
		passed directly to the translators as if they appeared as
		arguments in the translators table.  Keywords passed using
		this mechanism take precedence over keywords appearing in
		the translators table.  If no data descriptor is given,
		one may be constructed using DATA keywords (see below).  The
		newly created data descriptor is freed unless this argument
		is an undefined named variable, in which case the new
		descriptor is returned in this variable.

	arg2:	Transient translator argument, if present.

  OUTPUT:
	arg1:	If present and undefined, any newly created data descriptor
		is returnedin this argument.


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	ard:		Input array descriptors; used by some translators.

	override:	Create a data descriptor and initilaize with the
			given values.  Translators will not be called.

	verbatim:	If set, the descriptors requested using name
			are returned in the order requested.  Otherwise, the
			order is determined by the translators.

	tr_override:	String giving a comma-separated list of translators
			to use instead of those in the translators table.  If
			this keyword is specified, no translators from the
			table are called, but the translators keywords
			from the table are still used.


	ARRAY Keywords
	---------------
	All ARRAY override keywords are accepted.  See arr__keywords.include.
	If 'name' is specified, then only descriptors with those names are
	returned.

	DATA Keywords
	-------------
	All DATA override keywords are accepted.  See dat__keywords.include.

  OUTPUT:
	count:	Number of descriptors returned


 RETURN:
	Array of array descriptors, 0 if an error occurs.


 PROCEDURE:
	If /override, then a array descriptor is created and initialized
	using the specified values.  Otherwise, the descriptor is obtained
	through the translators.  Note that if /override is not used,
	values (except name) can still be overridden by specifying
	them as keyword parameters.  If name is specified, then
	only descriptors corresponding to those names will be returned.
