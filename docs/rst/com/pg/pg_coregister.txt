pg_coregister


 NAME:
	pg_coregister


 PURPOSE:
	Using the given geometry information, shifts the given images so as
	to center the given bodies at the same pixel in each image, or aligns
	images based on pointing.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	pg_coregister, dd, cd=cd, bx=bx


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dd:	Array of data descriptors giving images to shift.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	Array of camera descripors, one for each input image.

	bx:	Array of descriptors of any superclass of BODY, one for each
		input image.

	gd:	Generic descriptor containing the camera and body
		descriptors or an array of generic descriptors, one for each
		input image.

	center: Image coordinates at which to center each body.  By default,
		the average center among all the bodies is used.  If this input
		contains a single element, it is taken as the index of the
		input image to use as the reference.

	p:	Array (1,3) giving surface coordinates at which to center
		each body.

	xshift:	Additional image offset by which to shift each image.

	wrap:	If set shifted pixels are wrapped to the opposite side
		of the image.

	subpixel: By default, each image is shifted by an integer number of
		  pixels in each direction. If this keyword is set, the
		  image is interpolated onto a new pixel grid such that the
		  sub-pixel shift is obtained.  (Not currently implemented)

  OUTPUT:
	shift:	Offset applied to each image.


 SIDE EFFECTS:
	The given data and camera descriptors are modified: the images are
	shifted and the camera descriptor optic axes are changed accordingly.


 STATUS:
	Complete
