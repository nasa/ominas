pg_reflection


 NAME:
	pg_reflection


 PURPOSE:
	Computes image coordinates of given inertial vectors projected onto
	surface of the given disks and globes with respect to the given
	observer.  Returns only the closest reflection point for each objoect
	point.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	pg_reflection, object_ptd, cd=cd, ods=ods, dkx=dkx, gbx=gbx


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	object_ptd:	Array of POINT containing inertial vectors.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	Array (n_timesteps) of camera descriptors.

	gbx:	Array (n_globes, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects
		which must be a subclass of GLOBE.

	dkx:	Array (n_disks, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects
		which must be a subclass of DISK.

	bx:	Array (n_disks, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects
		which must be a subclass of BODY.

	od:	Array (n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects
		which must be a subclass of BODY.  These objects are used
		as the source from which points are projected.  If no observer
		descriptor is given, then the light descriptor in gd is used.
		Only one observer is allowed.

	gd:	Generic descriptor.  If given, the descriptor inputs
		are taken from this structure if not explicitly given.

	dd:	Data descriptor containing a generic descriptor to use
		if gd not given.

	  All other keywords are passed directly to pg_reflection_globe
	  and pg_reflection_disk and are documented with those programs.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	Array (n_disks,n_objects) of POINT containing image
	points and the corresponding inertial vectors.


 STATUS:
	Soon to be replaced by a new program that merges pg_reflection_globe and
	pg_reflection_disk.  The API for the new routine may be slightly different.


 SEE ALSO:
