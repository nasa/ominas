pg_ptscan


 NAME:
	pg_ptscan


 PURPOSE:
	Attempts to find points of highest correlation with a given model
	centered near given features in an image.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	result = pg_ptscan(dd, object_ptd)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dd:		Data descriptor

	object_ptd: 	Array (n_pts) of POINT giving the points.
			Only the image coordinates of the points need to be
			specified.

  OUTPUT:
       NONE

 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
       model:          Point spread model to be used in correlation.  If
                       not given a default gaussian is used.

	wmod:		x, ysize of default gaussian model.

	wpsf:		Half-width of default gaussian psf model.

       width:          Width to search around expected point location.  If
                       not given, a default width of 20 pixels is used.

	radius:		Width outside of which to exclude detections whose
			offset varies too far from the most frequent offset.
			Detections with offsets outside this radius receive
			correlation coefficients of zero.

       edge:           Distance from edge from which to ignore points.  If
                       not given, an edge distance of 0 is used.

       ccmin:          If given, points are discarded if the correlation
                       is below this value.

	chisqmax:	Max chisq between the model and the image.

       gdmax:          If given, points are discarded if the gradiant of
                       the correlation function is higher than this value.

	smooth:		If given, the input image is smoothed using
			this width before any further processing.

	median:		If given, the input image is filtered using
			a median filter of this width before any further
			processing.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	An array of type POINT giving the detected position for
       each object.  The correlation coeff value for each detection is
       saved in the data portion of POINT with tag 'scan_cc'.
       The x and y offset from the given position is also saved.


 RESTRICTIONS:
	Currently does not work for multiple time steps, only considers
	one point per given POINT.


 PROCEDURE:
	For each visible object, a section of the image of size width +
       the size of the model is extracted and sent to routine ptloc to
       find the pixel offset with the highest correlation with the given
       model.


 EXAMPLE:
	To find stellar positions with a correlation higher than 0.6...

       star_ptd=pg_center(bx=sd, gd=gd) & pg_hide, star_ptd, gd=gd, /rm
       ptscan_ptd=pg_ptscan(dd, star_ptd, edge=30, width=40, ccmin=0.6)

	pg_ptfarscan

 STATUS:
	Complete.


 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
 	Written by:	Haemmerle, 5/1998
	Modified:	Spitale 9/2002 -- added twice model width to search
			width.
