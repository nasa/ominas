nv_message


 NAME:
	nv_message


 PURPOSE:
	Prints an error message and halts execution.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/SYS


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	nv_message, string


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	string:	Message to print.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	name:		Name to use for the calling routine instead of
			taking it from the traceback list.

	anonymous:	If set, the traaceback list is not used to infer the
			name of the calling routine.  In this case, a name
			is printed nly if explicitly specified using the 'name'
			keyword.

	continue:	If set, execution is not halted.

	stop:		If set, execution is halted in nv_message.

	get_message:	If set, the last message sent through nv_message
			is returned in the _string keyword and no other
			action is taken.

	clear:		If set, the last message is cleared and no other action
			is taken.

	cb_tag:		If set, the callback procedure below is added to
			the cllaback list under this tag name and no other
			action is taken.

	cb_data_p:	Pointer to data for the callback procedure.

	callback:	Name of a callback procedure to add to the callback
			list.  Callback procedures are sent two arguments:
			cb_data_p (see above), and the message string.

	disconnect:	If set, the callback identified by the given cb_tag
			is removed from the callback list and no other
			action is taken.

	explanation:	String giving an extended explanation for the message.

	verbose:	Floating value in the range 0 to 1 specifying the
			verbosity threshold.  If set, and no string is given,
			then the threshold is set to this value.  If a string
			is given, then it will only be printed if this
			value is greater than or equal to current verbosity
			level.  Setting this keyword implies /continue.
			Verbosity threshold rules of thumb are as follows:

			 0.1:	Useful messages that you don't always need to see;
				files being loaded, written, etc.
			 0.5:	Useful messages that you want to see even less;
				file-not-found warnings, etc.
			 0.9:	Debugging messages that don't produce huge
				outputs.
			 1.0:	Mega debugging messages that may create
				huge outputs.  Your short message will get lost
				in this output, so use 0.9 instead.



	silent:		Suppressed printing of messages.

	format:		Format string.


  OUTPUT:
	message:	If /get_message, this keyword will return the last
			message sent through nv_message.


 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
	NV_VERBOSITY:	Initial verbosity setting.


 RETURN: NONE


 STATUS:
	Complete
