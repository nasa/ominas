DEMO
OMINAS Demo module

  The demo scripts are a useful way to get started using 
  OMINAS.  This module contains those scripts and the data 
  (images, cubes, SPICE kernels, ...) required to run them. 
  The scripts are located in $OMINAS_DIR/demo/ and may be
  run from the shell prompt (from the demo/ directory) as:

  % ominas <script>

  Some demo scripts accept command-line arguments, which are 
  described in the header at the top of the script file.  
  You are encouraged to examine the demo scripts and use 
  them as a basis for developing your own OMINAS tools.  
 
  Note that some scripts require other modules (e.g., SPICE) 
  to be installed and active to function properly.  All of
  the required modules are installed and activated by the 
  any of the initial installation options, but problems 
  could be encountered with a custom installation or 
  subsequent re-configuration.
